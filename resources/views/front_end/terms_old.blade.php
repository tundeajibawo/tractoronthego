Transport services are provided by operators under a contract (with you) for the carriage of farmers. Operators provide transport services on an independent basis (either in person or via a company) as economic and professional service providers. Disputes arising from consumer rights, legal obligations or from law applicable to the provision of transport services will be resolved between the farmers and operators. Data regarding the operators and their transport service is available in the TOG app and receipts for journeys are sent to the email address listed in passenger’s profile.</p> 
                                    <p>1.2 When using the TOG app, you can choose whether to pay the operators for the transport service or use TOG in-App Payment. Payments for TOG Business rides are handled by a separate agreement for Business journeys. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges may include other applicable fees, tolls, and/or surcharges including a booking fee, municipal tolls, airport surcharges or processing fees for split payments.</p>
                                    <p>1.3 During the installation of TOG app, passenger’s mobile number is linked to the respective TOG user account and added to our database.
